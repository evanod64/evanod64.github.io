  content-1="The Alpheya brand “contours” are used as a supporting graphical element. They can convey different aspects of the brand based on arrangement, repetitions, and proximity.

  Motion acts as an emphasis for these brand aspects - The ebb and flow of these patterns is designed to feel like natural expansion and compression. I developed a motion system for using these patterns which expand, shift, and rotate around each other in different compositions. 
  
  We expressed these motion patterns throughout our designs, in the Alpheya website, social, and out of home mockups."
