It serves as a review of the team's work and summary of the project, including an emphasis on the custom problem-solving efforts by CM to create a figma component-based graphic system for ultimate flexibility."

content-1="The Wove manifesto video was storyboarded in Figma and animated in Adobe After Effects. It is made up of the “wove fabric,” a visual system of intertwined strands that form larger graphics. It is created entirely in 2-dimensions, without any 3D assets.

The extreme wide-screen nature of the Wove manifesto required a unique usage of the brand elements, text, and motion in order to ensure legibility from all angles, on a screen over 150 feet wide."

After navigating multiple screen ratio adjustments, file formats, and evolving scripts, we ended up delivering over 40 individually animating assets to the conference production team."
