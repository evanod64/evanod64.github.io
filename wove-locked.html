              BNY Mellon's internal tech incubator, Pershing X, was building an industry changing wealth management platform. It was one of BNY Mellon's most ambitious projects, a unified platform to be used by thousands of advisor firm clients, serving millions of investors, and managing billions of dollars.

<br><br>The team at Critical Mass created the strategy, name, and brand identity for the platform, preparing to launch the new product at BNY Mellon's INSITE 2023 conference.
